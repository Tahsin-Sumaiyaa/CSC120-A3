This is my pseudocode to start my java code project:

1. Creating a method to define the assigned mirror words of certain pronouns.

2. Creating a method to store some fixed responses if no mirror word is found.

3. Creating a method to store the responses in a transcript.

4. Creating the main function that will carry all the commands:
-  a. Asking user how many rounds of convo do they want.
-  b. Printing a welcoming message. Ex: Hello. What's on your mind? And saving that in transcript.
-  c. Receiving users response, finding mirror words, saving the response in the transcript.
-  d. Answering---> if mirror word: Changing the mirror word and adding a "?" at the end.
      else: Giving a random fixed response
      Saving the response in the transcript.
-  e. Repeat c and d
-  f. Ending convo with a fixed response. Ex: It was a nice convo. But I have to go charge myself now :3. See yaaa! 
      And of course saving that in transcript.
