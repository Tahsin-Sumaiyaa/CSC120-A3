Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? 
Yvonne and Ayesha

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? 
Sunday (7:40 to 9 am, Fernendo(Sorry I forgot the name), Casey)

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It's not as easy as python. But I like the seperation of methods where each parts are defined individually alongside the main function containing all the necessary commands for the program. It's organized and easy to follow in that way.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
In class, we discussed the general differences between Python and Java. However, from personal experience, I have previously conducted computational research using Python, which I believe would not have been possible with Java; even if it were, it would be too complicated. Also, for object-oriented programming, such as creating a robot with multiple functions in one system and operating on different levels at the same time to produce an output, Java is the go-to. While Python is good for research and calculations, Java is good for creating systems with complex multitasking capabilities.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
To Future Students: Before doing A-3, try to understand the basics of loops, conditions, input (scanner), and output (print). Then create a step-by-step pseudocode (or pretend to teach a child how to train their teddy to talk to people). There is no need to use programming terms. Then try to do the steps in Java; you do not have to be perfect; include comments like class, methods, main functions, and so on. See if it runs. Then try to make it perfect!
Also, take help.
Writing pseudocode was extremely helpful. I went to the TA session because my program displayed an error message stating that it could not find the file's path, despite the fact that the path was clearly defined. My TA assisted me in resolving the situation. She also assisted me with the pseudocode, which is a life saver in programming (now that I know)!
